        - Spider-baby, it's got the body of a spider, and the mind of a baby.

        - Were you in Vietnam, sergeant?
        - Ah, no no, I mean, you know, the films.
        - This is a piece of advice my father gave to me. Now this refers not only to lagging, but all forms of insulation. He said, 'don't ever...' no, wait, it was, 'always...' no er, 'never, never' â€“ oh wait now, I've forgotten.
        - Dougal, do we have any incense?
        - FECK OFF CUP!
        - Now come on Father, what would you say to a nice cup of tea?
        - So you took Father Jack out for a walk... and you lost him. Again.

        - Chair! Curtains! Floor!
        - Father Hackett's got very fond of that brick. It's a great old pet for him! He doesn't have to feed it or clean it or take it to the vet. Suits him down to the ground!
        - I love my brick!
        - Honestly, Dougal, could you not knock the old rollerblading on the head for a couple of weeks?
        - There's nothing stupid about football! And there's nothing at all stupid about the annual All-Priests Five-a-Side over 75s Indoor Football Challenge Match, against Rugged Island!
        - I think it might work, Dougal. I know it'll work. It will work.
        - It won't work, will it Ted?
        - Didn't you tell me once that Father Jack had a trial for Liverpool?
        - No... no, he was on trial, in Liverpool.
        - Dougal, I don't want you to be physio this year. I want you to... look after the corner flags.
        - Oh God, Ted, for a second there I thought you were going to give me something completely stupid to do.
        - But, Dougal, you can do that with any blackboard.
        - Do you not notice the holy smell of the room?
        - Sheep, like all wool-bearing animals, instinctively travel north, where it's colder, and they won't be so stuffy.
        - Aah! Brilliant. A load of people in a stable! It's the one thing I didn't expect.
        - Come on, Ted. A Volkswagen with a mind of its own. If that isn't scary, I don't know what is.
        - Go on go on go on go on go on go on go on go on GO ON!
        - What was it Jack used to say about the needy? He had a term for them.
        - Wow! I'm finding out all kinds of things I never knew about rocks.
        - My Lovely Horse, Running through the field, Where are you going, With your fetlocks blowing, In the wind.
        - I want to shower you with sugar lumps, And ride you over fences, I want to polish your hooves every single day, And bring you to the horse dentist.
        - Oh no, it wouldn't be on any maps. We're not exactly New York!
        - The ants are back Ted!
        - Oh yeah, like that time you told me I could praise him just by leaving the room.
        - You're supposed to be taking Father Jack for his walk!
        - How would cliffs be closed Dougal?
        - Well, um, the cliffs were closed for the rest of the day.
        - I tried but it's like trying to talk to a wall with a mustache!
        - Your brother is a doctor isn't he?
        - That would be quite common you know. The favourite son would become a doctor.
        - We're not sure. I think it's a combination of Babycham and Harpic!
        - You think I'd let Jack back into a normal parish after the wedding he did in Athlone, huh?!
        - No, no, no, you are here until all of that money is accounted for.
        - You went to Las Vegas, whilst that poor child was supposed to be in Lourdes!
        - And as for this...cabbage! The mere idea of letting him back into the real world, after the Blackrock incident...
        - The Passion of St. Tibulus. Now, His Holiness has banned it, but because of some loophole, the bloody thing's being shown on this godforsaken dump!
        - My God, the strings I had to pull to stop the Vatican getting involved!
        - I don't care if it's any good; all I know is we have to be seen to be taking a stand against it. I have been brought back from my holiday in California to sort it out! And that's where you and Larry and Moe come in.
        - Nothing is your area, Crilly. You do not have an area. Unless it is some sort of play area, with sandcastles, and buckets, and spades! Now do what you're told, right?!?
        - Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to say how we have a real treat in store for all ye fans of French cinema.
        - Is it subtitled or is it dubbed?
        - That wasn't a banana, Dougal.
        - They're even coming from Gdansk to see the film!
        - Oh Lord Ted!, why did you give him a drink?
        - Sack me! SACK ME! I made the BBC!
        - It's true what they say isn't it, you should never meet your heroes.
        - Did we not win Dick?
        - No we didn't win Cyril!
        - That Cyril McDuff's an awful eejit isn't he Ted?
        - Oh well, since I didn't humiliate myself too much last time, I might as well have a glass of champagne. Cheers!
        - Never mind, we can look for him in the morning.
        - Would you like him on manual or automatic, Father?
        - And of course the F-word father, the bad F-word. Worse than feck. You know the one I mean.
        - No, Father. 'Tis my money. I just didn't want to fill out the forms.
        - Ah come on Father, you're not dead, are you?
        - The pulse not being there is bad enough, but the heart stopping is the real danger sign.
        - Sure I wouldn't know, I'm from Donegal
        - Right, well it looks bad alright. I called Dr. Sinnot, I gave him the symptoms over the phone and he said he's probably dead alright.
        - That happened to my uncle once. His heart stopped, and he was fine afterwards.
        - Karma karma karma karma karma chameleon...
        - If you're a solicitor I'm Boy George!
        - Kettle's boiled there Ted.
        - Will I put more water in and turn it on again?
        - ...must be one of those ones that clicks off automatically.
        - Mmm... bit of steam there. Incidentally, did you bring any teabags?
        - Who's a bit of a moaning Michael tonight!
        - You're alright there, Ted. He's a fair bit away ... it might be worth speeding up a bit there.
        - God Ted, he's probably very cold now that his towel has blown away!
        - Dougal, this isn't a Bruce Willis film. I was thinking more along the lines of a raffle.
        - God Almighty, that's going to cost a fortune to fix. Where are we going to get the money? Think, Dougal, how can we raise some money?
        - But what they do have and no-one can deny this now, they have the finest collection of boilers in the world! And I include Canada in that!
        - Sorry Ted, I was looking at the ticket upside down.
        - Father Jack, where did you get the air freshener?
        - What's your favourite humming noise? Would it be mmm-mmmmm or would it be mmmm-mm?
        - The first one there, now that's the sound of a fridge humming and the second one, now that's the sound of a man humming
        - Now if you push me to it, I'd have to say my favourite colour is grey. No, blue. A soft blue with a hint of grey. No, orange. Yes, orange. I remember now.
        - No Dougal, very bad news. It's the Holy Stone of Clonrichert. The Vatican have decided to upgrade it to a Class II relic.
        - Right, father, now we're going to have a little elocution lesson.
        - Hello Father, did you hear about the whistle being stolen?
        - Oasis! I mean Oasis!
        - No, you can't say that either.
        - No. Anyway it's too late. I'm off to India for two months with a few friends. Ah, there they are.
        - Have you been reading those Roddy Doyle books again, Dougal!?
        - Where am I? What's that thing there? Are those my feet?
        - Yes Dougal. "Wrong". You remember right and wrong? The difference between the two?
        - Honestly Dougal, this is very basic stuff.
        - Sorry about that Dougal. I probably pushed you a bit hard there.
        - It was resting for a long time Ted
        - Different thing altogether Dougal. First of all, that money was just resting in my account before I moved it on!
        - It's more that we're friends with the horse that we want to jump around with it and have a good laugh with it.
        - Dougal's decided to name his new pet rabbit after you.
        - Ah Ted I've got used to calling him Father Jack! Can we not call Father Jack something else?
        - Crilly, it's me, Bishop Brennan.
        - Eh, 'Oo is dis? Zere is no Crilly 'ere!
        - Now this is the third time in the last six months! You may have heard of Brian Noonan, hmm? A very important Junior Minister, and a personal friend of mine.
        - Shut up, Crilly! Shut up! I'll make this quick. What would the following words suggest to you, "Jack", "sleep-walking" and "bollock-naked".
        - God, it's like a big rabbit rock festival!
        - In the vice, father.
        - Once again I am forced from my comfy fireside to deal with the cast of Police Academy.
        - Ted, did Len find the rabbits?
        - Did he call me Len again?
        - Because Dougal, my nerves are shot. I won't be able to relax until the only rabbit here is the one sitting in your head working the controls.
        - Ted, there's loads more in here. Look at this one. Doesn't he look like that fella Harvey Keitel?
        - Craggy Island. Yeah. Craggy Island's the place for me.
        - I see it as being a safe haven for those who wish to escape the hypocrisy of the mainland.
        - You're right Ted. I admit it! I have a problem!
        - Ah you do! And then you were hit by the car when you went down to the shops for the paper.
        - You must remember all that! And then you won a hundred pounds with your lottery card. Ah you must remember it Dougal!
        - And the police station went on fire, and you had to be rescued by helicopter.
        - The helicopter! When you fell out of the helicopter! Over the zoo! Do you remember the tigers? You don't remember?
        - Sister Assumpta, you know we really are only up for the basic booze, cigarettes and rollerblading deal. I mean, the getting up early thing is great but...
        - Alright, alright, having a bit of a laugh with the big thickos from the island. Where's our real breakfast?
        - Ted, I'd love a pop-tart.
        - Yes, Father Dougal likes his pop tarts first thing in the morning.
        - Again, same thing, He might not have come up with the idea but He'd be the one who'd give them the green light.
        - Father Stack, if you're trying to embarrass us, you're not succeeding.
        - Oh God! He must have seen his reflection! He's not supposed to see his reflection!
        - I haven't written anything, because I'm not really good at that type of thing. But I did a drawing.
        - What do you mean, parachute? I wasn't listening at the start, there. Why would I want a parachute?
        - The plane's in trouble, and there's a competition to see who gets a parachute.
        - I can't wait to see what's under tomorrow's window. I bet it's a donkey or something.
        - I have an awful, dreary, monotonous voice
        - Who's got the most boring voice?
        - Chair! Curtains! Floor! Gobshite!
        - Ted! Were you asking for a dramatic, exciting voice?
        - No. He said boring. He wanted a boring voice.
        - No, no no, there's no need to continue this, I'm not the best, I'm just the second best. Apparently the Golden Cleric is a runner-up prize. Well, I'm so sorry! Obviously I'm just an idiot!
        - Only, the farm takes up most of the day, and at night I just like a cup of tea.
        - Fargo! How's the champ?
        - Crilly, If you ever try to bullshit me like that again, I will rip off your arms.
        - I put the entire annual heating allowance on him to win.
        - Yes, we do have some sheep tea.
        - I don't think they drink tea Mrs Doyle. Not unless you have some sheep tea.
        - No. He's lost the trust of his sheep. That's punishment enough for a farmer who deals primarily... with sheep.
        - God, Dougal, you should have seen him. He's just a shadow of a sheep...
        - They say it's as big as four cats and it's got a retractable leg so's it can leap up at you better.
        - It lights up at night and it's got four ears, two of them are for listening and the other two are kind of back-up ears.
        - Its claws are as big as cups and for some reason, it's got a tremendous fear of stamps!
        - Right Ted, the way the Phantom of the Opera doesn't exist.
        - Look, I'm not going to get involved in another what exists and what doesn't exist debate, but I'm gonna have to insist you add those last two to the chart!
        - I think it would be an insult to you if I were to finish that sentence.
        - You'd better get going, actually. Milk gets sour y'know. Unless it's UHT milk, but there's no demand for that.
        - Ted! You forgot your brick!
        - Oh yes, I'm afraid you messed with the wrong milkman, Father.
        - Better get out the earplugs Father, because when that milk float goes up, you'll hear it all the way to the North Po-
        - You see, Father Jack has a great fondness for saying that particular word.
        - Well, it's the first time I've used that eye chart actually. I got it free with a promotional crate of Carlsberg.
        - You know what he'd love? He'd really love it if someone came up to him and said his catchphrase.
        - I DON'T BELIEVE IT!
        - WILL YOU SHUT UP! WILL YOU! WILL YOU PLEASE SHUT UP! WILL YOU SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP!
        - More bad news, Dougal. I've just been speaking to Father Ned Fitzmorris. He tripped on a paving stone and one of his kneecaps fell off. There's no way around it...I'm going to have to put him in goal.

      long_quotes:
        - Well, as long as we all go to America with you... that's the important thing. I think if I heard that I couldn't go for any reason, I'd have to say that that would be the single most crushing blow of my life. A disappointment like that? I don't see how I could live with it.
        - You're right, Ted. I used to be happy enough with me old bike â€“ I used to get a big buzz out of just going down to the shops on it, you know? But after a while... it just wasn't enough. I started going for bigger and bigger thrills... But I could give it up! Any time I wanted!
        - Oh, yeah. I'd say no-one ever does that to him. He'll think you're hilarious. You know, this is one of those times where I'm absolutely, one hundred million percent sure that you'll be doing the right thing. I can safely say that you definitely, definitely won't regret doing that.

And you know what, Ted, it lights up at night and it's got four ears, two of them are for listening and the other two are kind of back-up ears. Its claws are as big as cups and for some reason, it's got a tremendous fear of stamps! Mrs Doyle was telling me that it's got magnets on its tail, so's if you're made out of metal it can attach itself to you and instead of a mouth, it's got four arses!
        - NO CLUES!! I'll get it in a second. Father Ken Sweeney? Father Neil Hannon? Father Keith Cullen? Father Ciaran Donnelly? Father Mick McEvoy? Father Jack White? Father Henry Bigbigging?

Father Peewee Stairmaster? Father Jemima Ractoole? Father Jerry Twig? Father Spodo Komodo? Father Cannabranna Lammer? Father Todd Unctious?
        - Oh no, it wouldn't be on any maps. We're not exactly New York! No, the best way to find it is to head out from Galway and go slightly north until you see the English boats with the nuclear symbol. They go very close to the island when dumping the old 'glow-in-the-dark'
        - Did you get those specially? You can buy them down the shop. Any number you like - ah, one, seven, 20, 112. All the way up to 409, I think it is. If you want more, they send off for them. They come back in an envelope. Normal kind of thing. Rectangular, four corners, you know. That's the way I like them anyway, the old envelopes. No round envelopes for me!
        - Ah go on. Go on. Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on...
