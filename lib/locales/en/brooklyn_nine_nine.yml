      quote: 
        - All right, there's the robot I fell in love with.
        - Are those gummy bears wrapped in a fruit roll-up?
        - Boston? But it's so close to Salem. You do know what they do to witches up there, don't you?
        - But if you're here, who's guarding Hades?
        - Can you magically make everyone kind, sober, and fully dressed
        - Charles, given your daily life experiences, you're gonna have to be more specific.
        - Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. No doubt, no doubt, no doubt.
        - Every time someone steps up and says who they are, the world becomes a better, more interesting place. So thank you.
        - Fine. But in protest, I'm walking over there extremely slowly!
        - Hello, Raymond. How do you like my new office? Twentieth floor.
        - I asked them if they wanted to embarrass you, and they instantly said yes.
        - I bet it's really fancy. Like Beauty and the Beast fancy.
        - I can't wait to see the inside of Raymond's house. I'm gonna learn everything there is to know about him.
        - I don't want to hang out with some stupid baby who's never met Jake.
        - I even managed to eat some plain toast this morning.
        - I have zero interest in food. If it were feasible, my diet would consist entirely of flavorless beige smoothies containing all the nutrients required by the human animal.
        - I only have one dream a year, always on Tax Day. In it, I must file an extension. So, yes, it is best not to have dreams.
        - I wanna build a spaceship!
        - I was raised on disco.
        - I'm considering it. I'm interested. I agree to participate.
        - I'm in a state of total euphoria.
        - If anything, love has made me smarter. Remember last week, when I boiled that egg?
        - If we're away from our desks for too long, they'll update our computers and we'll lose Minesweeper.
        - If we're going by what I'm most passionate about, I'm a woodworker.
        - It's the most fun day of the year. Something you wouldn't understand because you're not programmed to feel joy.
        - Look, this screw has three pointy sides, and nowhere to screw it in!
        - My mother cried the day I was born, because she knew she would never be better than me.
        - No, it's probably just an empty, white cube with a USB port in it for him to plug his finger in when he's on sleep mode.
        - Oh my God, she's totally gonna flunk us. I haven't gotten an F since I failed recess in second grade.
        - Oh, I love being Scary Terry. He says what regular Terry's thinking.
        - Oh, I really am. I'm really into rented clothes. I love how many butts have been in them.
        - Oh, I've caused a problem. I think I am getting a text message. Bloop. Ah, there it is.
        - Peralta, are you eating an Italian sub for breakfast?
        - Santiago, I know that you hate Halloween, but stick with me, and I promise you, you will love it.
        - That is never what people mean by that.
        - The English language can not fully capture the depth and complexity of my thoughts. So I'm incorporating Emoji into my speech to better express myself. Winky face.
        - There's a typo in this crossword puzzle.
        - This isn't the championship cummerbund. This is some common cummerbund.
        - We're gonna take the fight to them. Like some waddling ducks!
        - We've narrowed it down to two choices. Petey or Paulie.
        - Well, someone said it to me last night. Oh, must have been my wife.
        - What is this glutinous monstrosity before me?
        - Why am I not astride my noble steed, clad in armor?
        - With all due respect, that Pigeon is clearly a Ray-Jay.
        - Yes, I never thought I'd see you this high without a broom under you.
        - Yes, but my software is due for an exuberance upgrade.
        - You guys, this is gonna be fine. I mean Terry's our boss and he comes with us every year.
        - You're not Cheddar; you're just some common *****!
        - Your butt is the bomb. There will be no survivors.
