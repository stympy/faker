      quotes:
        - I'm Clark Kent. And you're in Smallville.
        - I stand for truth, justice, and... other stuff.
        - This is Smallville, land of the weird, home of the strange.
        - Clark, you can quit if you want but remember... quitting's a very hard habit to break.
        - You were right all along, Mr. Kent. I am the villain of the story.
        - We're special, Clark. People like us don't need boundaries and limitations.
        - Save your strength, Clark. I'm going to need it.
        - You know, Clark, there is one thing I'll never forget... ...  ...how important your friendship is to me.
        - Nice guys normally have the most issues.
        - Save the cloying maternal posturing for your own son, Mrs. Kent.
        - The American version of closure. You can only get over your grief when you figure out how to merchandise your tragedy.
        - Clark Kent never operates on the same speed as the rest of the world.
        - Kids just don't fall out of the sky, Martha.
        - Sweetheart, we can't keep him. What are we gonna tell people? We found him out in a field?
        - We didn't find him... he found us.
        - Statistical fact. Clark Kent can't get within five feet of Lana Lang without turning into a total freak show.
        - I'm hanging out in a graveyard. Does this strike you as okay behavior?
        - As soon as you start breaking the law of gravity, we're definitely in uncharted territory.
        - You were tied to a stake in the middle of a field. Even the Romans saved that for special occasions.
        - It's amazing how far that Kent charm will get you.
        - Did you know you can see my house from here?
        - Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of.
        - Right now, I hold the record for most dishes broken in a single day.
        - So, what are you, Clark? Man or Superman?
        - I'm just interested in people who ruled the world before they were thirty.
        - Trust me, Clark. Our friendship is going to be the stuff of legend.
        - I think I hit you at 60 miles an hour. Then you ripped open my roof, pulled me out, and saved my life.
        - Clark, you're our son, whether you can bench press the tractor or not.
        - You have the most amazing being on Earth doing chores on your farm!
        - He's not your son, you deluded hick! He's not even human!
        - Now I know something's wrong. The only person who says "hunky-dory" is my father.
        - Trust me. Next time I have a date, I'll be able to take her out without setting her on fire.
        - All my life, I've had to second-guess the intentions of others. I'd reached the point where I'd started to think friends were a luxury I couldn't afford, til I met you Clark. From the day you pulled me out of that river, you've been the one person I could trust completely.
        - What would you say if I told you Miss Atkins a.k.a. Alison Sanders, showed up at my loft last night and... tried to seduce me.
        - Besides being accused of being a serial arsonist and trying to sleep with my best friend's wife, I'm great.
        - Oh yeah, that's me, Cupid's cannon fodder.
        - Let's define ourselves by what we do, not who we date... or don't date.
        - Clark Kent seems to be immune to some members of the opposite sex.
        - Hello? I'm Clark! I'm the kid who can lift up tractors and see through walls!
        - If the aliens came to Earth, don't you think they'd find a place a little more exciting than Smallville?
        - So you're telling me you never once looked in the girls' locker room?
        - Okay, what planet is that guy from, and what did he do with Clark?
        - Excuse me, Mr. Gibbons. I think she looks really hot and I think that your dress code... sucks.
        - I think our not-so-normal son might be going through some classic teenage rebellion.
        - Clark would have to be on drugs to be on drugs.
        - I wasn't aware that a $2,000 coat came with a backbone.
        - Clark Kent and Lex Luthor. I like the sound of that.
        - I don't think a ghost could polish off three pieces of chocolate cake and two cappuccinos.
        - Aww, it's hard being Smallville's only goth.
        - It was prophesied that Naman would fall from the skies in a rain of fire. They say that Naman will have the strength of ten men and will be able to start fires with his eyes.
        - His name was Jimmy.  He was very cute, in a bow tie kind of way.
        - Okay, Clark. You may be impervious to the cold but I'm turning into a human Popsicle.
        - Oh, my god, I can't believe this! I'm Mrs. Clark Kent!
        - No! I don't think that rock forces you to do anything! Maybe it dampens your inhibitions, but... Clark Kent got himself into this situation, okay? Clark Kent asked me to marry him. Clark Kent brought me up to this hotel to make love to me.
        - Actually, I found him. Well, hit him actually. But not hard. We call him "Clarky."
        - You're gonna find that Clark's charm is an acquired taste, much like his sense of fashion.
        - Um, Smallville Medical Center has a surveillance system which, as far as you know, I've never hacked into, because... that would be... wrong.
        - Yeah! Remy Zero!!
